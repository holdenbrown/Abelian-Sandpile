# Abelian-Sandpile
1D grid represents the world and sand falls into the world and stacks until a certain point then topples over piling up around the base making other piles until the whole map is covered.
The user can enter coordinates to make pitfalls where if the sand falls it gets deleted.
made to run in a linux terminal.
